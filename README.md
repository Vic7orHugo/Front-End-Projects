# Front-End-Projects

  I'm starting this repository because I want to start a carrer, and to me, the Front-End Web Development field is a good way to do so. I like programming, and until now, I've been enjoying everything I built so far. All the projects are using HTML and CSS, and most of them have JavaScript. I want to let people know that they can get/copy the code if they find it useful, and I hope I can get help from this community whenever I need. I hope that this will mark the start of my career.

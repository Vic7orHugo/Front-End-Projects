          <h4 class="text-dark">This is a small part of his life on a timeline:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Born on June 11, 1959;</li>
            <li>Only son of John and Blythe House;</li>
            <li>Military brat - his father served as a Marine Cops aviator;</li>
            <li>Because his father moved to other bases, he presumably got his affinity for languages during this period;</li>
            <li>He hates his father for being abusive to him on his childhood, assuming since then he wasn't his real father;</li>
            <li>Later, he discovers his father was not his biological father;</li>
            <li>First attended Johns Hopkins University as an undergraduate;</li>
            <li>Before fully committing to medicine as his discipline, he considered getting a Ph.D. in Physics, researching dark matter;</li>
            <li>He was accepted to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and excelled during his time there;</li>
            <li>He was a front runner for a prestigious and competitive internship at the Mayo Clinic; however, another student, Philip Weber, caught him cheating, resulting in his expulsion from Johns Hopkins and rejection from the internship. While appealing his expulsion, he studied at the University of Michigan Medical School, and worked at a bookstore, where he met his future employer and love interest Lisa Cuddy, with whom he shared a night when "he gave her everything she asked for".;</li>
            <li>Approximately ten years before the beginning of the series, House entered into a relationship with Stacy Warner (Sela Ward), a constitutional lawyer, after she shot him during a "Lawyers vs. Doctors" paintball match;</li>
            <li>Doctor Wilson is his best friend, and pretty much his only friend;</li>
            <li>House fakes his own death in the series finale, thus giving up his ability to practice medicine again, in order to spend time with Wilson, who has five months left to live. He does this in order to avoid being sent back to prison for destroying an MRI machine in a prank gone wrong. The series ends with House and Wilson riding off into the countryside on motorcycles, as Dr. Robert Chase takes over House's department;</li>
